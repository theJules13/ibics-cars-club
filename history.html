            <h2>History of IBICS Cars Club</h2>
            <p>In November 1996, IBICS was founded as the first German-speaking interest group dedicated to the brands Iso and Bizzarrini. Martin Aeschlimann, along with several brand enthusiasts, established this institution at that time.</p>
            
            <p>The popular publication "ibics facts" has since been released in more than 50 editions and remains the only German-language publication regularly covering the Iso & Bizzarrini brands.</p>
            
            <p>IBICS has been present on the internet since 1998 and currently boasts around 60 members, including many from abroad. In 2009, the interest group was transformed into an association.</p>
            
            <p>Over the years, IBICS has organized memorable events for its members and has been instrumental in assisting with numerous restorations of Iso and Bizzarrini vehicles.</p>
